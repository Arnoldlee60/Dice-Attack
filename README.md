Description: An rpg focused game with a twist of dice rolling to determine the outcome of commands decided by the user

Known Bugs/ Issues: 
1. Dice rolling animation does not work. At one point it did but it does not work with the current code that we have.
2. Dice face does not show when gaining the initial amount of mana for the character.
3. Not a real issue but when losing the game, it transitions immediately to the lose screen with no enemy attack animation.
4. End turn / Start turn button sizes are different.
5. Sometimes animation fade makes the next time you use it not show up.
6. Victory screen points can only be one value since all there is to increment points is how many times you win and points don't get added to the board if you lose.
